# Ants NFT Collection

## 0. Introduction

About 100 million years ago ants and wasps were one species which explains why the Founding Queens and prince consorts are big almost like wasps and have wings. However, something happened that forsed some wasp colonies to become more social than the others which meant that most citizens had to give up their individualizm for the benefit of the colony. For example, every worker ant is a female and can potentially lay eggs. But the colony prevents them from laying their own eggs but rather forces to support the **Queen** and her descendants. 

## 1. Colony roles & appearance

Even though every ant is born from an egg, its speciality is reflected by its physical appearance similar, but more distinctive than uniforms of humans.
