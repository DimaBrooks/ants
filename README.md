# Ants NFT Collection

## 0. Introduction

### Ants are a form of wasps
About 100 million years ago ants and wasps were one species which explains why the Founding Queens and Prince Consorts of Ants are almost as big as wasps and have wings at the beginning of their career. However, something happened that forsed some wasp colonies to become more social than the others which meant that most citizens had to give up their individualizm for the benefit of the colony. For example, every worker ant is a female and can potentially lay eggs. But the colony prevents them from laying their own eggs but rather forces to support the **Queen** and her descendants.

### One egg - different specialties
The specialty of an individual ant depends on the level of care and nourishment the parents and the larva received. If the food was scarce - all the larva will grow into workers to get more food. If the food was abundant, some of the larva will turn into a "**princess ant**."

### Just like Amazonians
Ants' societies very much resemble those of mythological Amazonian ones. The head of the state is a Queen. The colony only comprises females. Males from foreign settlements are used once for mating and then they either naturally die or get killed and eaten by the female warriors or workers.

### Ants live in democracy 
Ant queen resembles the Brittish Queen, who **reigns but does not rule**. There is no supreme commander in an Ant colony. Worker ants decide all the questions by **proposing** ideas and **voting** for them by the **majority**. Scout ants research the environment. After they find what they consider worthy, they mark it with pheromones and return to the colony's nets. There they share their impressions of the finding. Depending on their own satisfaction of the found they produce more or less intensive pheromones. If the level of pheromones is attractive to the other ants, they join the scouts and visit the found item too. They form their own impression and repeat the cycle. When the majority agrees that what was found is worth their attention all the colony arrives to a **consensus** about what to do with the found.

## 1. Colony roles & appearance

Even though every ant is born from an egg, its speciality is reflected by its physical appearance similar, but more distinctive than uniforms of humans.

|Item|Name|Example Image|General Description|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|
|1|Egg|<img src="./assets/Egg.jpg" alt="Egg" width="200px">[^1]|An organic vessel for protecting and incubating a foetus. The egg almost does not interacting with the external environment. Its surface is sticky which allows carying multiple eggs by a worked ant at the times of danger.|
|2|Larva|<img src="./assets/Larva.jpg" alt="Larva" width="200px">|A juvenile form of Ant during its metamorphosis from an egg to an adult. Unlike the egg, larva consumes food brough by the workers to fuel growth and transfomation. The larvae have no legs but are capable of some minor movement, such as bending their head toward a food source when fed. Larva produces liquid pheromones that workers eat and dry junk that workers throw away.|
|3|Pupae|<img src="./assets/Pupae.jpg" alt="Pupae" width="200px">|Some ant spices's larva are cocoon-spinning. They wrap themselves in thin silk threads before becoming pupae. In other species, cocoons are not used during pupae. They are out in the open and their development can easily be observed. The pupae starts out white, as the larvae, but darkens over time. All pupae are positioned in a foetal position with lowered heads and bodies shaped much like a banana.|
|4|Worker|<img src="./assets/PharaoAntWorker-no-bg.png" alt="Worker" width="200px">|When the pupae is fully grown and has begun to darken, it will wake up. For the first days of it’s life it will be lightly coloured and transparent in comparison to the other members of the ant colony. But after a few days it will darken and gain the same markings as it’s sisters. Most ant species let the new ants (also called nanitics) live their first time in safety, tending to the eggs, queen and other inside-duties of the colony. Then eventually they will look towards more dangerous tasks such as foraging or defending the nest. The closer one ant is to death (by age), the more economically motivated the colony is to risk it’s life.|
|5|Soldier|<img src="./assets/LeafcutterSoldierAnt.jpg" alt="Soldier" width="200px">||
|6|Prince consort|<img src="./assets/AntMale-no-bg.png" alt="Prince consort" width="200px">|A male **alate** (winged) version of an ant. On the same for for the other colonies moment, usually, on a hot day after rain, it takes part in a "**nuptial flight**" when alate femails mate with alate males from foreign colonies. After a female is far enough from her original colony, she produces pheromones attracting the males. But she does not couple with the first or nearest ones. She flies away from them as fast as she can to only mate with the fastest. After mating the male dies not to be a burden for a colony. For some ant species the male's inner genitals explode into the female's **spermatheca** and quickly dies. <br/><br/>Some species' Queens from existing colonies can produce pheromones that attract foreign males. As the attracted males land near the nest they are attacked by the nest's guards and their wings get cut off and eaten. They are driven to the nest by the workers. Males produce pheromones communicating the purpose of intrusion. If the worker ants like the pheromones they bring the bewinged male to the queen for mating. Otherwise, they kill and feed him to their larva.|
|7|Queen|<img src="./assets/AntQueen.jpg" alt="Queen" width="200px">|If fed well a larva can develop into a winged **princess ant** destined to leave the colony and hopefully found her own. After their virgin "**nuptial flight**" fertilized by a foreign male a **princess ant** becomes a **founding queen**. She finds the right place for a new colony, usually far enough from the original colony for the original family to never find the offspring. She diggs a whole and lays her first eggs. She feeds and takes care of the first larva all by herself. She even sacrifices her wings to feed them. But once they grow up, they become her first team and army. <br/><br/>The young queens have an extremely high failure rate. During its lifetime a very large ant colony can send out millions of virgin queens. Assuming that the total number of ant colonies in the area remains constant, on average only one of these queens succeeds. The rest are destroyed by predators (most notably other ants), environmental hazards or failures in raising the first brood at various stages of the process. This strict selection ensures that the queen has to be both extremely fit and extremely lucky to pass on her genes to the next generation. <br/><br/>Successful queens live up to 20-30 years.|
